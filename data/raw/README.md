# Predictive Maintenance – Engine Sensor Dataset

This dataset contains multivariate time-series sensor data collected from engines.
It is used for predictive maintenance modeling, where the objective is to predict
engine failure events based on operational settings and sensor readings.

## Files:
- raw_data.csv: Raw engine sensor dataset

This dataset is versioned and stored on Hugging Face to ensure reproducibility
and auditability for machine learning experiments.


## Columns
- `Engine rpm`
- `Lub oil pressure`
- `Fuel pressure`
- `Coolant pressure`
- `lub oil temp`
- `Coolant temp`
- `Engine Condition`
